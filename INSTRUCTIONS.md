## Technical Specifications

- The website should work well on a tablet or larger screen

## Code Quality

- Include comprehensive documentation and comments
- Always consider whether a certain feature or functionality can be abstracted into its own module for future use in another context. Favor abstraction where possible.

## Version Control

- Provide succinct messages for `git commit` and commit often
